            <li>What is JavaScript? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows us to implement complex features on web pages like it creates dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What is the use of isNaN function? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.isNaN() Method.

                    <br>Syntax:
                    
                    isNaN( value )
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What is negative Infinity? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:- The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.JavaScript shows the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Which company developed JavaScript? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:- Brendan Eich, a Netscape Communications Corporation programmer, created JavaScript in September 1995. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:- Undeclared − It occurs when a variable which hasn’t been declared using var, let or const is being tried to access. <br>

                      Undefined − It occurs when a variable has been declared using var, let or const but isn’t given a value.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                        Ans:- document.createElement("<tagName>"); <br> 
                              // Where <tagName> can be any HTML <br>
                              // tagName like div, ul, button, etc. <br>
                            
                              // newDiv element has been created <br>
                              For Eg: let newDiv = document.createElement("div");<br>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState? </li>

                            <td>Maintained at page level only.</td>
                            <td>Maintained at session level.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.</td>	
                            <td>Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.</td>
                            <td>In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.</td>
                            <td>used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.</td>
                            <td>SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts.</td>

            <li>What is === operator?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different. <br>
                    Syntax: <br>
                    x === y
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-The document.getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document with the “id” attribute and the “className” attribute can be used to change/append the class of the element. <br>
                    Syntax:<br>
                    document.getElementById('myElement').className = "myclass";
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method. This technique reads the full file into memory and stores it in a buffer. <br>
                    Syntax: <br>
                    fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:<br>
                    <ol>
                    <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times.</li>
                    <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object.</li>
                    <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.</li>
                    <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</li>
                    <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</li>
                    </ol>                
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-parseInt() is a function that converts the string input into an integer value. After users run their code, the parseInt() function returns an integer of a base which the second parameter specifies in the parseInt() function.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What is the function of the delete operator? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-The delete operator deletes an object, an object's property, or an element from an array. The operator can also delete variables which are not declared with the var statement.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript? </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-There are three types of pop up boxes :<br>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Alert box</li>
                        <li>Confirm box</li>
                        <li>Prompt box</li>
                    </ol> 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What is the use of Void (0)?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-It means return undefined as a primitive value. We use this to prevent any negative effects on a webpage when we insert some expression.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:-We can use window.location object to load another page in JavaScript. eg: window.location = “Path / URL”
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ans:- <ol type="i">
                               <li>inner HTML is slow</li>
                               <li>Event handlers attached to any DOM element are preserved</li>
                               <li>It is not possible to append innerHTML</li>
                               <li>Replacement is done everywhere</li>
