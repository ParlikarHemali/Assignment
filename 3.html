                            To embed audio in HTML,we use < audio > tag.Before HTML5 we can't add audio in web pages. After the release of HTML5 it is possible to add audio in web pages. <br>
                       Syntax:
                            < audio >
                               < source src="file_name">

                             </audio>

                             To embed video in HTML, we use the < video > tag. <br>
                             Syntax:
                                    < video >
                                        < source src="file_name"> 
                                    < /video > <br>
                                    <video controls>
                                     <source src="./video/One Direction - Perfect (Official Video).mp4">
                                    </video>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                <li>Semantic element in HTML5?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ans:- <p>Semantic elements have meaningful name:s which tells about type of content. For example header, footer, table, … etc. HTML5 introduces many semantic elements as mentioned below:</p>

                            <li>Article: It contains independent content which doesnt require any other context. </li>
                            <li>Aside: It is used to place content in a sidebar i.e. aside the existing content. It is related to surrounding content.</li>
                            <li>Details and Summary: “details” defines additional details that the user can hide or view. “summary” defines a visible heading for a “details” element.</li>
                            <li>Figure and Figcaption: These are used to add an image in a web page with small description.</li>
                            <li>Header: As the name suggests, it is for the header of a section introductory of a page. There can be multiple headers on a page. </li>
                            <li>Footer: Footer located at the bottom of any article or document, they can contain contact details, copyright information etc. There can be multiple footers on a page.</li>
                            <li>Main: It defines the main content of the document. The content inside main tag should be unique.</li>
                            <li>Section: A page can be split into sections like Introduction, Contact Information, Details etc and each of these sections can be in a different section tag.</li>
                            <li>nav: It is used to define a set of navigation links in the form of navigation bar or nav menu.<nav: It is used to define a set of navigation links in the form of navigation bar or nav menu./li>
                            <li>Mark: It is used to highlight the text.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li> Canvas and SVG tags</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ans:- <p>The < canvas > tag in HTML is used to draw graphics on a web page using JavaScript. It can be used to draw paths, boxes, texts, gradients, and adding images. By default, it does not contain borders and text. <br>
                            The < canvas > tag is new in HTML5. <br>
                        Syntax: < canvas id = "script" > Contents... < /canvas >
                    </p> <br>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas">
                    </canvas>
                        
                        <script>
                        var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
                        var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
                        ctx.fillStyle = "red";
                        ctx.fillRect(20, 20, 75, 50);
                        
                        //Turn transparency on
                        ctx.globalAlpha = 0.2;
                        ctx.fillStyle = "blue"; 
                        ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 75, 50); 
                        ctx.fillStyle = "green"; 
                        ctx.fillRect(80, 80, 75, 50);
                        </script>
                    <p>
                        The < svg > tag is used as a container for SVG graphics.

                            SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a language for two-dimensional graphics based on XML with support for animation and interactivity. To draw images, it uses simple geometrical figures (circle, lines, polygon, etc.).
